/*Solution to workshop:*/

/*1. Create 2 Tablespaces: one with 1 Gb and 2 datafiles, tablespace should be named "?vehicles_fleet?" and the other one with the name "?test_purposes?" with 500 Mb and 1 datafile.*/

CREATE TABLESPACE vehicles_fleet 
datafile 'DTF_one.dbf' size 500M,
'DTF_two.dbf' size 500M;

CREATE TABLESPACE test_purposes 
datafile 'DTF_3.dbf' size 500M;

/*2. Create an Undo tablespace with ?5Mb? of space and 1 datafile.*/

CREATE UNDO TABLESPACE  vehicles 
datafile 'DTFUNDO_4.dbf' SIZE 5M;

/*3. Set the undo tablespace to be used in the system.*/

ALTER SYSTEM SET UNDO_TABLESPACE = vehicles;

/*4. Create a DBA user and assign it to the tablespace called "?vehicles_fleet?", this user has unlimited space on the tablespace.*/

CREATE USER USUARIODBA
identified by DBA123
default tablespace vehicles_fleet 
quota unlimited on vehicles_fleet;

/*5. Assign the dba role and permissions to connect to the user just created */

/*6. Create 3 profiles. */
/*a. Profile 1: "?manager_profile?" password life 40 days, one session per user, 15 minutes idle, 4 failed login attempts.*/

/*b. Profile 2: "?finance_profile?" password life 15 days, one session per user, 5 minutes idle, 2 failed login attempts.*/

/*c. Profile 3: "?service_profile?" password life 20 days, one session per user, 10 minutes idle, 3 failed login attempts.*/

/*d. Profile 4: "?development?" password life 100 days, two session per user, 30 minutes idle, no failed login attempts.*/

/*7. Create 1 role with the name "?without_privileges?" and revoke ALL PRIVILEGES.*/

/*8. Create 4 users, assign them the tablespace "?vehicles_fleet?"; profiles created should be used for the users, all the users should be allow to connect to the database.*/ 
/*Use the role "?without_privileges?" for users associate with profiles: ?manager_profile?, ?finance_profile? and ?service_profile?.*/

/*9. Lock the users associate with profiles: ?manager_profile?, ?finance_profile? and ?service_profile?.*/
